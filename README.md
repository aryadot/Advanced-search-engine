# **Advanced Search Engine**

## **Project Overview**
The **Advanced Search Engine** is a powerful search system that supports complex boolean queries and utilizes advanced ranking algorithms like PageRank and Dirichlet smoothing to provide highly relevant search results. The engine processes both ordered and unordered term windows, enhancing query analysis and improving accuracy for users.

## **Key Features**
- **Boolean Query Support:** Handle complex boolean queries with operators like AND, OR, and NOT to refine search results.
- **Query Analysis:** Perform advanced query analysis using ordered and unordered windows of terms, allowing for more accurate search matches.
- **Ranking Algorithms:** Implement PageRank and Dirichlet smoothing to rank documents by importance and enhance the relevance of search results.
- **Accurate Search Results:** Evaluate and optimize search accuracy using advanced algorithms and feedback loops.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A React-based frontend allows users to easily search and filter results.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django)
- **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch for indexing and searching.
- **Frontend:** React for building the user interface.
- **Ranking Algorithms:** PageRank and Dirichlet smoothing, implemented with Scikit-learn.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for document and index storage.

## **Installation Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/advanced-search-engine.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd advanced-search-engine
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up the PostgreSQL database and Elasticsearch instance (refer to the `config/database_setup.md` for detailed instructions).
5. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. In a separate terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the React dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
7. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## **Usage Instructions**
1. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Enter a query using boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine your search.
3. View search results, ranked by relevance using PageRank and Dirichlet smoothing.
4. Filter the results based on categories or query terms.
5. Use the visualizations to see the ranking distribution and relevance scores.
